# Explore US Bikeshare Data Using Python
Project submission as part of the Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree from Udacity. 

In this project, I make use of Python (NumPy and Pandas) to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I have written code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. It also includes a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data Using Python

### Description
The attached Python file is the final code used to analyze bikeshare data from three cities: Chicago, NYC, and Washington. The program takes a user-driven input approach and shows different statistics based on the input choices.

### About the source data
The dataset consists of randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 for all the three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

[1] Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57), [2] End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53), [3] Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776), [4] Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave), [5] End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave), [6] User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns: Gender and Birth Year.

### Statistics Computed
#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time): most common month, most common day of week, and most common hour of day

#2 Popular stations and trip: most common start station, most common end station, most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

#3 Trip duration: total travel time, average travel time

#4 User info: counts of each user type, counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago), and earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
