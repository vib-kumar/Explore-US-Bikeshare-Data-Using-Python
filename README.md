# Explore US Bikeshare Data Using Python
Project submission as part of the Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree from Udacity. 

In this project, I make use of Python (NumPy and Pandas) to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I have written code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. It also includes a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
